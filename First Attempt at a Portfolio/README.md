# Old Portfolio - HTML Version

## About This Repository
This repository contains an old version of my portfolio website, which I created using basic HTML and CSS. I have uploaded this project to reflect on my growth as a developer and showcase the progress I have made since this initial version. From this simple static HTML portfolio, I have advanced to building a dynamic React application for my latest portfolio.

## Why I Uploaded This
In the journey of web development, growth is a constant. This old portfolio represents where I started—an early attempt to create something meaningful with limited knowledge. By comparing it with my current React portfolio, you can clearly see:

- **How far I've come**: From basic static pages to an interactive and feature-rich application.
- **The skills I've gained**: My ability to work with modern tools like React, manage state, and leverage external libraries and APIs.
- **The improvements in design and functionality**: A shift from a simple layout to a professional, polished look with responsive design and animations.

## Features of This Old Version
- **HTML structure**: Basic semantic HTML was used to organize content.
- **CSS styling**: Inline styles and a simple external stylesheet for visual presentation.
- **Static content**: All information was hardcoded, with no dynamic components or reusable code.

## Limitations of This Version
- Non-responsive design: The layout may not look great on smaller screens or mobile devices.
- No modularity: All code is tightly coupled, with no separation of concerns.
- Lack of interactivity: Limited user engagement due to the absence of modern JavaScript frameworks or libraries.

## Reflection and Progress
### Then:
- Tools: HTML and CSS.
- Focus: Learning how to build a functional portfolio to display my skills at the time.
- Challenges: Limited knowledge of responsive design, animations, and code organization.

### Now:
- Tools: React, CSS frameworks, responsive design principles, and modern libraries like React Icons and React Slick.
- Focus: Creating a professional, visually appealing, and dynamic portfolio that integrates reusable components, state management, and external APIs.
- Achievements: Building a portfolio that demonstrates my ability to develop complex applications and adopt industry-standard practices.

## Takeaways
This repository is not just a collection of code; it's a milestone. It represents the beginning of my journey in web development and serves as a reminder of the skills I’ve acquired along the way. Comparing this HTML version with my React portfolio is a testament to continuous learning and improvement.

Feel free to explore this old version to see how my journey started, and be sure to check out my current React portfolio to see how much I’ve improved!
